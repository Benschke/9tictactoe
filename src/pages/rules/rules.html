		<p><u>1.	Each turn, you mark one of the small squares</u></p> <br>
		<p><u>2.	When you get three in a row on a small board, you’ve won that board.</u></p><br>
		<p><u>3.	To win the game, you need to win more boards than your opponent.</u></p><br>


		<p><u>4.	You don’t get to pick which of the nine boards to play on.</u><br>
		&nbsp;-	That’s determined by your opponent’s previous move.<br>
		&nbsp;-	 Whichever square he picks, that’s the board you must play in next. (And whichever square you pick will determine which board he plays on next.)</p><br>

		<p><u>5.	What if my opponent sends me to a board that’s already been won?</u> <br>
		&nbsp; -In that case, congratulations – you get to go anywhere you like, on any of the other boards.</p><br>

		<p><u>6.	What if one of the small boards results in a tie?</u><br>
